1) Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions

<<<<<<< HEAD
In the context of an internet website, the front-end and back-end divisions refer to different aspects of its development and functioning. Let's explore their working in simple terms:

Front-end:
The front-end of a website is the part that users interact with directly. It encompasses the visual and interactive elements that users see and interact with in their web browsers. Here's how it works:

1. User Interface (UI) Design: Front-end developers work on designing the user interface of the website, including the layout, colors, typography, and overall visual aesthetics.

2. HTML Structure: The structure of the website is created using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). HTML defines the different elements and their arrangement on the page.

3. CSS Styling: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML elements, applying colors, fonts, margins, and other visual properties to make the website visually appealing and user-friendly.

4. Client-side scripting: JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website. It enables features like form validation, animations, and user interactions.

Back-end:
The back-end of a website consists of the server-side components that handle data processing, storage, and other functionalities that are not directly visible to users. Here's how it works:

1. Server-side programming: Back-end developers use programming languages like Java, Python, Ruby, or PHP to handle server-side logic. They write code that runs on the server and processes user requests.

2. Database integration: Back-end developers connect the website to a database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB. This allows for storing and retrieving data, such as user information, content, and other dynamic data.

3. Server-side frameworks: Back-end frameworks like Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, or Laravel provide a foundation for building robust and scalable web applications. They offer libraries and tools to handle routing, authentication, session management, and other server-side tasks.

4. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): Back-end developers create APIs that allow the front-end and external systems to communicate with the server. APIs define the rules and endpoints for exchanging data between the client and server.

Overall, the front-end focuses on creating an engaging and user-friendly interface, while the back-end handles the server-side operations, data processing, and database management. Both work together to deliver a seamless and functional web experience to users.
=======
The front-end, also known as the client-side, refers to the part of a website that users interact with directly. It encompasses the design, layout, and user interface elements visible in a web browser.

Front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including libraries like React, are used to build the user interface and enhance the user experience of websites and web applications. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language that structures the content of web pages, defining the elements and their layout. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for the visual presentation of HTML elements, allowing developers to customize the design, colors, typography, and layout of the website. JavaScript is a versatile programming language that enables interactivity and dynamic behavior on the client-side, enabling developers to create animations, handle user events, and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web page. React, a popular JavaScript library, provides a component-based architecture for building reusable UI elements and efficiently updating the user interface based on changes in data.

The back-end, also known as the server-side, refers to the behind-the-scenes processes that handle data storage, processing, and communication between the website and various databases, servers, and external services.

On the back-end, technologies like Express, MongoDB, and Node.js come into play. Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building server-side applications. It provides features for routing, middleware management, and handling HTTP requests and responses. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side, making it possible to build scalable and efficient back-end applications. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format, offering scalability and high performance. It is often used in conjunction with Node.js and Express to handle data storage and retrieval, allowing for the development of dynamic and data-driven web applications.

By leveraging these technologies together, developers can create full-stack web applications that offer a seamless and interactive user experience. The front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, React, and JavaScript) handle the user interface and client-side interactivity, while the back-end technologies (Express, MongoDB, and Node.js) manage server-side processing, data storage, and communication with databases. This combination enables the development of feature-rich web applications with a responsive and engaging user interface.

2) What are tags in HTML? Explain the each category of tag with an Example.

In simple terms, a tag in HTML is like a label that tells the web browser how to interpret and display different elements on a web page. It consists of a name enclosed in angle brackets (< >). For example, the `<h1>` tag is used to indicate a heading, while the `<p>` tag represents a paragraph of text. Tags help structure the content and apply formatting, such as making text bold or creating clickable links. They are like instructions that browsers follow to show the webpage correctly. Tags are an essential part of creating web pages and enable developers to organize and style content effectively.

Here are some categories of HTML tags:

1. Structural Tags:
   - `<html>`: Represents the root element of an HTML document.
   - `<head>`: Contains metadata and other information about the HTML document.
   - `<body>`: Encloses the main content of the HTML document that is visible in the browser.

2. Heading Tags:
   - `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Defines different levels of headings, with `<h1>` being the highest level and `<h6>` the lowest.

3. Paragraph Tags:
   - `<p>`: Represents a paragraph of text.

4. Formatting Tags:
   - `<em>`: Emphasizes text, usually displayed in italic.
   - `<u>`: Underlines text.

5. Link Tags:
   - `<a>`: Creates a hyperlink to another web page or resource.

6. Image Tags:
   - `<img>`: Embeds an image in the webpage.

7. List Tags:
   - `<ul>`: Represents an unordered list.
   - `<ol>`: Represents an ordered list.
   - `<li>`: Defines a list item within an unordered or ordered list.

8. Table Tags:
   - `<table>`: Defines a table.
   - `<tr>`: Represents a table row.
   - `<td>`: Defines a table cell.

9. Form Tags:
   - `<form>`: Creates an HTML form for user input.
   - `<input>`: Creates various types of input fields within a form.
   - `<button>`: Creates a clickable button within a form.

3) Explain the working Procedure of Virtual DOM.

The Virtual DOM is a technique used in frameworks like React to update web interfaces efficiently. Here's how it works:

1. Initial Rendering:
   - A lightweight copy of the web page's structure, called the Virtual DOM, is created.
   - It represents how the page should look based on the initial data and components.

2. Component Updates:
   - When something changes in the app's data or user interactions occur, affected components are re-rendered.
   - Instead of directly changing the real web page, a new Virtual DOM is created.

3. Comparison:
   - The new Virtual DOM is compared with the previous version to find the differences.
   - It identifies which parts of the page need to be updated.

4. Updating the Real DOM:
   - Only the necessary changes are made to the actual web page, known as the Real DOM.
   - This minimizes the number of updates needed.

5. Improved Performance:
   - By using the Virtual DOM, React optimizes the process of updating the web page.
   - It reduces the time and resources required for rendering.

so , the Virtual DOM is a clever way to update web pages efficiently. It creates a copy of the page, compares it with the previous version, and updates only the necessary parts. This helps improve the performance of web applications and provides a smoother user experience.


4) Mention some Differences between MySQL and No SQL

MySQL is a structured, table-based database system that uses SQL for querying and is suitable for complex joins and transactions. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, offer flexible schema and various data models, with different querying mechanisms. They are efficient for scalability and high volumes of data, making them popular for modern web applications and big data systems. NoSQL databases may sacrifice strict consistency for improved scalability.

|    | MySQL                                 | NoSQL                                       |
|----|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1. | Relational Database Management System | Non-Relational Database Management System    |
| 2. | Structured Data Storage               | Flexible Schema and Document-based Storage   |
| 3. | Table-based Data Model                | Various Data Models (Key-Value, Document, etc.) |
| 4. | SQL (Structured Query Language)        | Querying Mechanisms Vary (e.g., MongoDB uses a query language called MongoDB Query Language) |
| 5. | ACID Compliant                         | ACID Compliance Depends on the NoSQL Database |
| 6. | Suitable for Complex Joins and Transactions | Efficient for Scalability and High Volume of Data |



5) Explain any one DBMS Technology in your own words.


MongoDB is a NoSQL database management system known for its flexibility and scalability. It stores data in JSON-like documents called BSON. Unlike traditional databases, MongoDB doesn't require a fixed schema, allowing for easy adaptation to changing application needs. 

With MongoDB, you can query data using a powerful language called MQL. It supports indexing for faster queries. MongoDB can scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers and offers built-in replication for high availability.

MongoDB delivers high performance through efficient memory usage and disk storage. It's well-suited for modern applications that deal with semi-structured and evolving data.
